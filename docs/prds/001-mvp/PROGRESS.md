## Phase 1: Foundation & Auth
**Dependencies:** None (starting point)

- [x] Google OAuth authentication via Convex Auth
- [x] User model with storage tracking
- [x] Basic error boundary
- [x] PostHog integration
- [x] Responsive layout shell (mobile + desktop)

**Notes:**
- Next.js 16 with React 19 and Tailwind CSS 4 (CSS-first config)
- Convex schema fully defined, requires `npx convex dev` to deploy and generate types
- shadcn/ui components installed: button, card, dialog, form, input, label, sonner, avatar, badge, separator, sheet, dropdown-menu, select, textarea, tabs, table, progress, slider, checkbox
- PostHog provider with manual pageview tracking
- Mobile-responsive navigation with Sheet sidebar on mobile

## Phase 2: Bands & Collaboration
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (need auth and users)
**Spec:** [SCHEMA.md](./SCHEMA.md)

- [x] Band CRUD with soft deletes

- [x] Band member list view

**Notes:**
- Created `convex/bands.ts` with queries (listMyBands, get, getByInviteCode) and mutations (create, update, softDelete, regenerateInviteCode)
- Created `convex/bandMemberships.ts` with queries (listByBand, getMyMembership) and mutations (join, leave, updateInstruments)
- 6-character invite codes using safe characters (no 0/O/1/I/L confusion)
- Users can rejoin bands they previously left (clears `leftAt`, preserves history)
- Last member cannot leave - must delete band instead
- Only band creator can delete the band
- Uses `getAuthUserId` from `@convex-dev/auth/server` for reliable user lookup

## Session Notes

### Session: January 19, 2026
**What was done:**
- Initialized Next.js 16 project with TypeScript, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4
- Installed and configured Convex with @convex-dev/auth for Google OAuth
- Created full Convex schema from SCHEMA.md spec (13 tables)
- Set up shadcn/ui with essential components
- Created responsive dashboard layout with mobile navigation
- Built sign-in page with Google OAuth button
- Added error boundary component with PostHog error capture
- Configured PostHog analytics provider
- Updated PRD docs to use PostHog instead of Sentry

**Next steps:**
- Run `npx convex dev` to deploy schema and generate types
- Configure Google OAuth credentials in Google Cloud Console
- Add environment variables to .env.local
- Test authentication flow end-to-end
- Begin Phase 2: Bands & Collaboration

**Context to remember:**
- TypeScript errors will resolve after running `npx convex dev`
- The generated `_generated/` folder will be created by Convex
- Google OAuth callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`

### Session: January 20, 2026
**What was done:**
- Implemented Phase 2: Bands & Collaboration
- Created Convex functions for bands and memberships (queries + mutations)
- Built UI components for band management (dialogs, cards, lists)
- Added 6-character shareable invite codes with safe character set
- Implemented band member list with instrument picker
- Added leave/delete band functionality with proper business rules
- Fixed auth user lookup to use `getAuthUserId` from Convex Auth
- Added `tokenIdentifier` field to users schema (for future use)
- All manual tests passing: create band, copy invite code, join band, view members, update instruments, leave band, delete band

**Next steps:**
- Begin Phase 3: Songs & Files
- Implement song CRUD with practice status
- Add file upload with size validation and storage quotas

**Context to remember:**
- Use `getAuthUserId(ctx)` from `@convex-dev/auth/server` for getting authenticated user ID
- Band membership uses soft delete via `leftAt` timestamp
- Invite codes are 6 chars from safe set: ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789
